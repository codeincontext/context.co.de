    <h2>description</h2>
      <p>
      I build digital products for startups and large companies. I have a background in coding and software architecture but also know the design process and the methodologies that lead to successful startup businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
      I believe in cross-disciplinary teams, close collaboration, and releasing early. I value business goals over technical purity and am comfortable making technical tradeoffs. I like working with smart people, bringing my experience to the table, and learning all I can from those around me. I&rsquo;m often handing over code and always build software with the next developer in mind.

    <h2>Recent work</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>The Beano:</dt> <dd>Brought in as an extra pair of hands for six weeks, I ended up being the consistent thread in the technical team for nearly a year. I architected and led development on a large React codebase used across multiple platforms<small> [browser, node, iOS, Android]</small>. We used Rails for an API and CMS built to the needs of a content team. The project had various UX and compliance challenges specific to the child audience, and is now in the safe hands of a new full time team.</dd>

        <dt>The car manufacturer:</dt> <dd>A three month innovation project exploring a problem space and future business model for the car industry. Paid to act like a founder, I was empowered to explore and de-risk the business as if it were my own. Problem space exploration, smoke tests, prototypes, customer interviews, iteratively designing and validating a proposition.</dd>

        <dt>The bank:</dt> <dd>Working on a controversial product for a C-level executive at a major bank. A change of focus one week in, a 12 week project cut to 6, an organisational web to navigate, physical and organisational impediments, handover to a team in China... if you were trying to sabotage a project it might look like this. Yet we still delivered a working prototype and delighted very senior stakeholders<small> [Global Head of Digital]</small>.</dd>

        <dt>ITV general election:</dt> <dd>Using customer development techniques to decide how best to cover the UK general election while minimising expensive platform changes. Included meetings with integration partners, time with journalists and editors, and a focus on retained functionality for future politics coverage.</dd>

        <dt>Skype in the Classroom:</dt> <dd>Led development in a phase focused on discovery and search. I continued in this role as Skype partnered with Code.org, working with a subcontractor in fast, iterative sprints. The project made teachers happy, boosted Skype&rsquo;s brand, cleared serious technical debt, and won major awards<small> [iXDA and two Webbys]</small>.</dd>

        <dt>ITV publisher:</dt> <dd>ITV&rsquo;s publishing system allows them to break news faster than other news organisations while supporting their 700k daily uniques. As the system grew, small race conditions had begun to appear. I used the advantages of their existing technology<small> [Redis] </small>to implement a smarter representation of data; meaning we could remove the unreliable job queue performing future work that could fail. This feat ended up touching 71 files.</dd>

        <dt>Ghost:</dt> <dd>Audited and refactored an early version of the Ghost blogging engine.</dd>

        <dt>Tinie Tempah:</dt> <dd>I built an app with custom Shazam-like technology for Warner Music Group. When the app detects one of Tinie&rsquo;s songs, it drops you into a video of his lips rapping along in perfect time. Fans can hold it to their mouth and &ldquo;rap like Tinie&rdquo;. The app was a success; repeated antics from celebrities like Nick Grimshaw<small> [Radio 1] </small>pushed download numbers, and extended functionality for album owners drove new sales.</dd>
